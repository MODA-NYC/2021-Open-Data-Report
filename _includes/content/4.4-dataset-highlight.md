## Cool It! NYC 2020 - Cooling Sites 

Cool It! NYC is a citywide plan focused on increasing the number of cooling features available to the public during heat emergencies, particularly in neighborhoods vulnerable to the dangers of high heat.  Last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic made gathering indoors risky, the mission of creating more outdoor cooling elements took on additional urgency.
This dataset represents the hundreds of cooling features â€“ including water sprayers, misters, and more that were activated as a part of this plan. These new cooling elements were installed using various existing water sources in parks, including drinking fountains and ground hydrants. To learn more, visit the [interactive map of cooling sites across the city](https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/health-and-safety-guide/cool-it-nyc), which also includes information on tree canopy cover to show which streets and parks are leafiest.
