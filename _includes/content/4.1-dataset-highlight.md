## NYC Clean Soil Bank Generating and Receiving Sites

The Mayor's Office of Environmental Remediation’s (MOER) NYC Clean Soil Bank recycles clean, native soil from deep excavations at construction sites undergoing environmental cleanup in NYC to City capital projects, other cleanup sites, and community gardens. This program, made possible through an agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, keeps clean soil in the city rather than shipping it beyond the city for disposal and provides projects with clean soil to adjust land elevation, build wetlands, prevent lead exposure, and fortify shorelines.

This dataset features both the generating and receiving sites affiliated with this program. Generating sites must meet certain environmental standards, while receiving sites include public construction projects, projects that advance social equity goals, and projects that remediate contaminated land. Both public and private sites within the City can apply to be part of the Clean Soil Bank.
