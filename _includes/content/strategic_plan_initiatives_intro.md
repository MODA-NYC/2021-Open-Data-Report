<h1>Strategic Plan Update</h1>

Two years ago, the Open Data Team brought together City employees, civic hackers, open data evangelists, and good government advocates in a two-day workshop to reflect on the successes and challenges of the first ten years of open data in New York City. During the workshop, the participants co-created a vision for the next decade of NYC Open Data, which the Open Data Team used in tandem with a public survey to write the strategic plan for the next ten years of NYC’s Open Data. This strategic plan encompasses 27 initiatives across three main areas: improving user experience, strengthening the City’s capacity, and building communities. 

As part of last year’s report on Open Data, we provided an update on each initiative with highlights on specific areas of progress. While our plans to implement some of these initiatives have shifted in two years time, we are continuing to work on seeing them forward, and what follows is a two-year update on the strategic plan. As with last year, each initiative has a Status Update, and many have “Status Notes” to share more detail on the work that is underway or planned.

<u><b>Statuses</b></u>

**In progress:** Meaningful work has begun on this initiative. In some cases, portions of the initiative are complete while others remain underway. In those cases, additional detail is available in the Status Notes column. <br>
**Planning:** The Open Data Team has begun to work on the planning and preparatory work necessary for this initiative. <br>
**Future:** The Open Data Team has not yet started working on this initiative or work is temporarily on hold as other initiatives are moved forward. <br>
