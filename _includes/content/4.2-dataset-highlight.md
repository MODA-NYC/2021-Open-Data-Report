## Street Sign Work Orders

NYC’s Department of Transportation (DOT) manages approximately a million street signs across every road and neighborhood in New York. This dataset contains information from the  Sign Information Management Systems (SIMS), which is used to track all street regulation signs installed by the DOT Sign Shop. 

Included in this dataset is information about the types of signs that are installed, their construction, their installation date, and repair history. This dataset can be used with the [Street Name Sign Work Orders](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Street-Name-Signs-Work-Orders/guiy-frxt) (which contains signage of street names as opposed to the regulation signs in this dataset), [Parking Meter Locations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Parking-Meters-GPS-Coordinates-and-Status/5jsj-cq4s), or [Parking Meters ParkNYC- Blockfaces](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Parking-Meters-ParkNYC-Blockfaces/s7zi-dgdx) datasets to better understand the history of signage in a particular location.
